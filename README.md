Two player in-browser Tron-inspired game made in Two.js.

[Live demo](https://beatobongco.com/lightcycles/)

## Controls

### Player 1

WASD - change direction
T - shift up
Y - shift down

#### Player 2

arrow keys - change direction
\[ - shift down
\] - shift up

## Shifting

There are 3 gears. Tap once to shift. Each gear increases how fast you go uniformly. e.g. gear 3 is 3 times faster than gear 1 but is harder to control

This concept was created to prevent [key rollover](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)>).
